# Discourse2MD

[中文](./README.md) | [English](./README.en.md)

## Overview

Discourse2MD is a userscript for Discourse topic pages. It exports topics as Markdown or writes them directly into Obsidian.

The project targets generic Discourse sites rather than a single branded forum. The default root example uses `Linux.do`, but the script itself is not Linux.do-specific.

This repository currently provides two language variants:

- `discourse2MD-cn.user.js`
- `discourse2MD-en.user.js`

They are two UI languages for the same tool and share the same userscript identity and stored settings. Install only one of them at a time.

Current capabilities:

- export to a browser-downloaded generic GFM Markdown file
- export directly to Obsidian through Local REST API
- browser Markdown exports keep remote image links and avoid Obsidian-only syntax
- Obsidian image storage: `file` / `local-plus` / `base64` / `none`
- export templates: `forum` / `clean`
- rule-based filters: post range, OP only, image filter, users, keywords, minimum length
- AI filtering for low-value replies
- YAML frontmatter plus Obsidian-enhanced export formatting
- duplicate topic detection, directory overview, and fallback browser download link

## Prerequisites

### 1. Install a userscript manager

Use any of the following:

- [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
- [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)
- [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) (Firefox)

### 2. If you want Obsidian export, install Local REST API

You can skip this section if you only want browser Markdown download.

1. Install and open [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
2. Go to `Settings -> Community plugins`.
3. Disable safe mode, then install [Local REST API](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/obsidian-local-rest-api).
4. Enable the plugin.
5. Copy the API key from the plugin settings.

Additional notes:

- The default API URL is `https://127.0.0.1:27124`.
- If the local HTTPS certificate is not trusted, the script will automatically fall back to local HTTP.

### 3. If you want `local-plus` storage mode, also install Local Images Plus

1. Install [Local Images Plus](https://github.com/Sergei-Korneev/obsidian-local-images-plus) from Obsidian community plugins.
2. Configure the attachment directory and localization behavior the way you want inside your vault.
3. After exporting with the unified script in `local-plus` mode, run Local Images Plus in Obsidian to convert remote image links in the note into local attachments.

## Installation

1. Install one script in your userscript manager:
   - Chinese UI: [`discourse2MD-cn.user.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chitiabao/discourse2MD/main/discourse2MD-cn.user.js)
   - English UI: [`discourse2MD-en.user.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chitiabao/discourse2MD/main/discourse2MD-en.user.js)
2. You can also open the corresponding script file in the repository and click `Raw` on GitHub to import it directly.
3. Save and enable it.
4. Open any supported Discourse topic page.
5. An export button will appear in the lower-right corner. Click it to open the export panel.

Upgrade note:

- If you previously installed the `local-images-plus/` variant, switch to the unified script manually and reselect the storage mode.
- This merge does not migrate stored settings from the old variant.

## Configuration

Once you open a Discourse topic page, the script panel contains two main areas:

- `Obsidian Settings`
- `Export Style`

### Obsidian Settings

| Field | Description | Default / Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API URL | Obsidian Local REST API endpoint | `https://127.0.0.1:27124` |
| API Key | Copied from the Obsidian plugin settings | Required for Obsidian export |
| Root | Top-level export path inside the vault, can be nested | Default `Linux.do` |
| Category | Single-level category folder under the current root | Default `Uncategorized` |
| Storage Mode | `file` / `local-plus` / `base64` / `none` | Default `file` |
| Image Directory | Image save directory, only used in `file` mode | Default `attachments` |

### Rules for root, category, and image directory

- `Root` is used to separate communities or top-level storage locations. Multi-level relative paths such as `Linux.do` or `Forum/Linux` are allowed.
- `Category` is always a single-level directory name and cannot contain `/` or `\`.
- `Image Directory` must be a relative path inside the vault and cannot contain `.` or `..`.
- In the current configuration model, the image directory is resolved relative to the selected root.
- If the selected root or category does not exist yet, it will be created on first export.

### Obsidian storage mode comparison

| Mode | Description | Advantage | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `file` | Saves images into the vault and references them with `![[...]]` | Smaller notes, reusable assets | Long-term Obsidian storage |
| `local-plus` | Keeps remote image links and leaves localization to Local Images Plus | No direct image writes from the script, easier to align with vault-side rules | Vaults already using Local Images Plus |
| `base64` | Embeds images directly into Markdown | Self-contained single file | Portable one-file exports |
| `none` | Skips image export entirely | Smallest output | Text-only archives |

Additional notes:

- `Export Markdown` always keeps remote image links and outputs standard `![]()` syntax, regardless of the Obsidian storage mode setting.
- The storage mode setting only applies to `Export to Obsidian`.
- In `file` mode, the effective image path looks like:

```text
<root>/<image-directory>/<topicId>/
```

- In `local-plus` mode, the script keeps remote image links and does not write image files directly.

### Directory overview and duplicate topic detection

The script shows a directory overview for the selected root and category, then scans existing notes by `topic_id` before export:

- if the same topic appears exactly once in the current category, the script asks whether to overwrite it
- if the same topic exists in another category under the same root, the script asks whether to continue and makes it clear that exporting will create another copy in the current category
- if both the current category and other categories match, the script shows a single confirmation that explains the overwrite target and the additional matches
- if multiple notes with the same `topic_id` exist in the current category, the script blocks export and asks you to clean them up first

## Usage

### Export to Markdown

1. Open the target Discourse topic page.
2. Choose a template under `Export Style` and configure filters if needed.
3. Click `Export Markdown`.
4. The script will trigger a browser download using generic GFM-compatible Markdown without Obsidian-only callouts, block references, or `![[...]]` image syntax.
5. If the browser does not save automatically, use the fallback download link shown in the panel.

### Export to Obsidian

1. Open the target Discourse topic page.
2. Fill in `API URL` and `API Key` under `Obsidian Settings`.
3. Click `Test Connection`.
4. Choose the root, category, storage mode, and the image directory used by `file` mode.
5. Under `Export Style`, choose a template and configure filters if needed.
6. Click `Export to Obsidian`.
7. On success, the note is written directly into the selected vault path.

## Filters and Export Templates

### Export templates

#### `forum`

- Exports YAML frontmatter.
- Includes a topic summary block.
- Exports the first post body the same way as `clean`, preserving Markdown structure as much as possible.
- Preserves reply order, author information, and reply relations for follow-up replies.
- In `Export Markdown`, replies use standard sections and regular anchor links.
- In `Export to Obsidian`, replies use callouts, block references, and wiki-style links.
- If filtering is enabled, the filter summary is written into the exported note.

#### `clean`

- Exports YAML frontmatter.
- Includes a topic summary block.
- Keeps only the first post body.
- Omits all follow-up replies.
- In `clean` mode, the filter settings do not affect the final content.

### Rule-based filters

The first post is always kept. Other posts can be filtered with the following options:

| Filter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Post Range | `All posts` or `Custom range` |
| OP Only | Keeps only posts from the original poster |
| Image Filter | No filter / posts with images only / posts without images only |
| Users | Keeps only posts from specified users; multiple values can be separated by commas, spaces, or semicolons |
| Include Keywords | Keeps posts that match any listed keyword |
| Exclude Keywords | Removes posts that match any listed keyword |
| Minimum Length | Removes posts shorter than the configured length |

Notes:

- The start post number cannot be greater than the end post number.
- The filter summary is only written into exported notes in `forum` mode.

### AI filtering

AI filtering is used to remove low-value replies such as pure thanks, pure agreement, meta-comments, or repost/source permission questions.

Required fields:

- `API URL`
- `API Key`
- `Model ID`

Behavior:

- The first post is always kept and is never sent to AI.
- AI only analyzes non-first posts that remain after the rule-based filters.
- AI returns only the candidate indexes that should be excluded.
- If AI filtering fails, the script falls back to its built-in rules and continues exporting instead of aborting the whole export.

## Output Examples

### Filename

```text
<title>-<topicId>.md
```

### YAML frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: "Topic Title"
topic_id: 12345
url: "https://example.com/t/topic/12345"
author: "op_username"
category: "Category Name"
tags:
  - "tag1"
  - "linuxdo"
export_time: "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z"
create_date: "2024-01-01 10:39:44"
edit_date: "2024-01-01 14:10:00"
floors: 50
---
```

Notes:

- `tags` include the original topic tags plus the extra `linuxdo` tag added by the script.
- `floors` is the final exported post count, not the total raw post count from the source topic.

### Generic Markdown example (`Export Markdown`)

```markdown
## Topic Info

- **Source URL**: [https://example.com/t/topic/12345](https://example.com/t/topic/12345)
- **Topic ID**: 12345
- **OP**: @username
- **Category**: Category Name
- **Tags**: tag1, linuxdo
- **Exported At**: 1/1/2024, 12:00:00 PM
- **Posts**: 50
- **Filters**: First post=always kept; Range=1-50
```

In `forum` mode, the first post body is exported like `clean`; follow-up replies use regular sections and standard anchors:

```markdown
<a id="floor-2"></a>

### #2 Username (@username) · OP · 1/1/2024, 12:00:00 PM

Post content...
```

When a post replies to another floor, the export uses a regular Markdown link:

```markdown
Reply to [post #12](#floor-12)
```

### Obsidian-enhanced example (`Export to Obsidian`)

The topic summary still uses a callout:

```markdown
> [!info] Topic Info
> - **Source URL**: [https://example.com/t/topic/12345](https://example.com/t/topic/12345)
> - **Topic ID**: 12345
> - **OP**: @username
> - **Category**: Category Name
> - **Tags**: tag1, linuxdo
> - **Exported At**: 1/1/2024, 12:00:00 PM
> - **Posts**: 50
> - **Filters**: First post=always kept; Range=1-50
```

Reply posts continue to use callouts, block references, and wiki-style links:

```markdown
> [!success]+ #2 Username (@username) 🏠 OP · 1/1/2024, 12:00:00 PM
> Post content...
> ^floor-2
```

```markdown
> > Reply to [[#^floor-12|post #12]]
```

## FAQ / Troubleshooting

### Test Connection fails

Check the following:

1. Obsidian is running.
2. The `Local REST API` plugin is enabled.
3. The API key was copied correctly.
4. Your browser is not blocking the local certificate connection.

### Local HTTPS certificate is not trusted

The script first tries `https://127.0.0.1:27124`. If the local certificate is not trusted, it automatically attempts a fallback to local HTTP.

If the connection still fails, manually visit:

```text
https://127.0.0.1:27124
```

and trust the certificate in your browser before retrying.

### Images do not display or fail to save

- In `base64` mode, failures are usually caused by source image download problems or network restrictions.
- In `file` mode, check that:
  - the API key is valid
  - the image directory is a valid relative path
  - Obsidian Local REST API can write to the target vault

### Export is slow

Common reasons:

- large topics require batched post fetching
- many images need downloading or conversion
- AI filtering adds extra API requests

If you only need part of the topic, narrow the export first with rule-based filters.

### Why am I seeing a duplicate topic warning

The script scans existing Markdown files under the selected root by `topic_id` so it does not overwrite the same topic silently.

- one match inside the current category: asks whether to overwrite
- matches in other categories under the same root: asks whether to continue and export another copy into the current category
- matches in both places: asks once and shows both sets of paths
- multiple matches inside the current category: blocks export until the duplicates are cleaned up

### How do I switch between Chinese and English

Disable or replace the currently installed script in your userscript manager, then import the other language variant.

Do not enable `discourse2MD-cn.user.js` and `discourse2MD-en.user.js` at the same time, because they share the same userscript identity and stored settings.

## Notes

- The repository and scripts target generic Discourse topic pages, not only Linux.do.
- Any mention of `Linux.do` in the README is only an example default root.
- The project is maintained as single-file userscripts and does not include a separate CLI, installer, or build pipeline.
- API keys, AI settings, and export locations are stored in userscript storage rather than repository files.
- The source of truth for the version is the `@version` field in the userscript metadata, not the README.
